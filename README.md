# Bubble
## Motivation
#### I have always been interested in creating a fluid programming language and thus for my senior research project I decided to work on the following Bubble Programming Language with my research partner Bharat Venkat.  For a detailed explanation of the project view the `ResearchPaper.pdf` attached.
## Steps to Run the program
#### 1. Download/Clone all files and folders listed in this repo to a local directory.<br />
  * __API.java__ contains all the methods the user can run.  The Bubble.java program will parse through the input and look for keywords.  Once a keyword is found it will call the appropriate method in API.java to run the keywords functionality.<br />
  * __Bubble.java__ is the main program which asks for a txt file of the english program and interprets and runs the program.<br />
  * __Data.java__ is a data structure I created to manage arbitrary datatypes.<br />
#### 2. Open the terminal or command prompt to the location of the directory where the files are saved. <br />
#### 3. Type `java Bubble` into the terminal. 
#### 4. When asked to input the input file type `Problem1.txt`.  
#### 5. You will then be asked to enter Input1.  Type an arbitrary integer.  You will then be asked to enter Input2.  Type an arbitrary integer.  The program will output the sum of the two numbers if it is odd or the sum / 2 is the sum is even. 
#### *Note: you can alter the program by editing Problem1.txt in the Text folder.
## Steps to use Bubble for your own basic English programs
#### 1. View the API.java program to see the basic methods you can write.
#### 2. View the programs in the `Bubble_Examples` Folder to view the structure your basic English program should resemble
#### 3. With this knowledge write the program and save it in the Text folder.  Follow the Steps to Run the program above except instead of inputing `Problem1.txt`, type the name of your program's text file.

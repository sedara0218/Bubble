Problem: The parameter weekday is true if it is a weekday, and the parameter vacation is true if we are on vacation. We sleep in if it is not a weekday or we're on vacation. Return true if we sleep in.

Bubble:

ask user, "Is it a Weekday?" and store value in userIn1
ask user, "Is it a Vacation?" and store value in userIn2

if userIn1 is = to Yes, then
	weekday is = to true
else
	weekday is = to false
	
if userIn2 is = to Yes, then 
	vacation is equal to true
else
	vacation is equal to false
	
if it is not a weekday and it is a vacation, then
	return true
else 
	return false
	
	
ask the user for two integer inputs and add the two integers together and divide them by 2

if the remainder is 0 then print the sum of the two numbers divided by two

if the remainder is 1, then print the sum

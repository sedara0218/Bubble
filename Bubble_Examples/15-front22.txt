Problem: Given a string, take the first 2 chars and return the string with the 2 chars added at both the front and back, so "kitten" yields"kikittenki". 
If the string length is less than 2, use whatever chars are there.

Bubble:
Ask user and store in str.
Define "2String2" as a function which is given a String tmp and returns a String.  The function stores the first 2 characters of tmp in c and returns c+tmp+c.
If str length is less than 2 then [return str] else [return 2String2 of str] 


Java:

public String front22(String str) {
  // First figure the number of chars to take
  int take = 2;
  if (take > str.length()) {
    take = str.length();
  }
  
  String front = str.substring(0, take);
  return front + str + front;
}

Problem: Given a string, we'll say that the front is the first 3 chars of the string. If the string length is less than 3, the front is whatever is there. Return a new string which is 3 copies of the front.

Bubble:
Ask user for string, "Input String: " and store in str.
//Define -> Used to define a method
Define "FRONT" to give the first 3 chars of a given String. //Default -> 0 index 
Define "FRONTv2" as the 3 characters from the 0th index of a String. 
If the length of the string is less than 3 then [return str] else [return the FRONT of str]


Java: 

public String front3(String str) {
  String front;
  
  if (str.length() >= 3) {
    front = str.substring(0, 3);
  }
  else {
    front = str;
  }

  return front + front + front;
}

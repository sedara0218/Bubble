Problem: Given an int n, return true if it is within 10 of 100 or 200. 

Bubble: 
Ask user for integer input, "Enter int n: " and store in int n.
If n is in range of 90 to 110 or if it is in range of 190 to 210 then [return true] else [return false].
//If n is [in range of 90 to 110 or in range of 190 to 210] then [return true] else [return false].

Java:
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.println("Enter int n: ");
int userReply = sc.nextInt();

//User forgets to include value in store value (store their reply) so Bubble sets it to the most recently created variable in line.
int n = userReply;

if (range(n, 90, 110) || range(n, 190, 210)) {return true};
else {return false;}

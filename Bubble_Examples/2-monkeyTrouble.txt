Problem: We have two monkeys, a and b, and the parameters aSmile and bSmile indicate if each is smiling. 
			We are in trouble if they are both smiling or if neither of them is smiling. Return true if we are in trouble.

Bubble:

ask user, "Is monkey a smiling?" and store in userIn1
ask user, "Is monkey b smiling?" and store in userIn2

if userIn1 is = Yes, then
	aSmile is equal to true
else
	aSmile is equal to false
	
if userIn2 is = Yes, then 
	bSmile is equal to true
else
	bSmile is equal to false
	
if monkey a is aSmile and monkey b is bSmile or if monkey a is not aSmile and money b is not bSmile, then
	return true
else
	return false

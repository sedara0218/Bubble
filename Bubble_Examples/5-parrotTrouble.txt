Problem: We have a loud talking parrot. The "hour" parameter is the 
current hour time in the range 0..23. We are in trouble if the parrot is talking and the hour is before 7 or after 20. Return true if we are in trouble.

Bubble (Basic):
1. Keep [asking user for integer input, "Enter hour" till [their reply is in range 0 to 23] and store in Integer hour].
2. If hour is less than 7 or greater than 20 then [return true], else [return false].

Java:
//Keep [asking user for integer input...till 
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
int userReply;

//asking user for integer input, "Enter hour" till [their reply is in range 0 to 23] and store in Integer hour].
while(userReply != null && range(userReply,0,23)) {
	System.out.println("Enter hour");
	userReply = sc.nextInt();
}

Bubble (Advanced-May have errors): 
1. Keep [asking user for Integer input, "Enter hour" till [their reply is in range 0 to 23] and if their reply is less than 7 or greater than 20 then [return true], else [return false]].

Java:
//Keep [asking user for integer input...till 
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
int userReply;

//asking user for integer input, "Enter hour" till [their reply is in range 0 to 23] and if their reply is [less than 7 or greater than 20] then [return true], else [return false]].
while(userReply != null && range(userReply,0,23)) {
	System.out.println("Enter hour");
	userReply = sc.nextInt();
	if (userReply < 7 || userReply > 20) {
		return true;
	}
	else {
		return false;
	}
}

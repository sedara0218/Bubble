Problem: Given an int n, return the absolute difference between n and 21, except return double the absolute difference if n is over 21.

Bubble:
1. Ask user for Integer input, "Input an integer: " and if their reply is less than 21 then [return the absolute value of the difference between n and 21], else [return double the difference between n and 21].

Java:
//Initialize Bubble Variables
Var v = new Var();

//Ask user for Integer input, "Input an integer: "
Scanner sc1 = new Scanner(System.in)
System.out.println("Input an integer: ");
int userReply1 = sc.nextInt();

//and if their reply is less than 21 then
if (userReply1 < 21) {
	//[return the absolute value of the difference between n and 21]
	return Math.abs(diff([n, 21]));
}

//else [return double the difference between n and 21]
else {
	return 2*diff([n, 21]);
}
